SOUND OF THE FUTURE
WAS INCORPORATED IN CARBONDALE, IL IN JUNE OF 2021. WE ARE MORE THAN JUST MUSIC, THIS IS WHERE CREATIVITY COMES TO GROW WITHOUT SACRIFICING YOUR INTEGRITY. WE FOCUS ON ARTIST MANAGEMENT, DEVELOPMENT, MEDIA, PRODUCTION, FINANCIAL LITERACY AND MORE. WE ARE MORE THAN JUST A LABEL, WE ARE A FAMILY.

SINCE OUR INCORPORATION WE HAVE WORKED WITH A NUMBER OF INDEPENDENT ARTIST. SOME THEIR WORK YOU WILL HEAR FEATURED ON THIS SITE ONCE RELEASED. WE HAVE MADE GREAT STRIDES IN THE INDUSTRY, AND HOPE TO CONTINUE TO DO SO WITH THE LOVE AND SUPPORT FROM THE FANS.

BEING INCORPORATED HAS BROUGHT US MUCH SUCCESS . SINCE THEN WE HAVE SECURED A DISTRIBUTION AND PUBLISHING DEAL WITH TUNCORE AND BMI. OUR YOUTUBE PAGE HAS BEEN MONETIZED. ONE OUR PRODUCERS HAS BECOME A REGISTER SONGWRITER/COMPOSERS THROUGH BMI ALSO HE IS A STUDENT AT THE LOS ANGELES FILM SCHOOL. OUR MUSIC HAS BEEN DOWN LOADED AND STREAMED THROUGH EVERY SOCIAL MEDIA AND STREAMING SITE OUT THERE. WE ALL KNOW THE STORY STARTS HERE, BUT IT DOESNâ€™T END HERE.
